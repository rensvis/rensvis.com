Design systems bring consistency and efficiency to product development. In Flutter, you can build one using `ThemeExtensions`, custom widgets, and a clear token hierarchy.

<Callout type="info">
  Flutter 3.16+ includes improved `ThemeExtension` support. Ensure you're on a recent stable release.
</Callout>

## Theme extensions

Flutter 3.16+ introduced `ThemeExtension`, which lets you add custom theme data:

```dart
@immutable
class AppColors extends ThemeExtension<AppColors> {
  const AppColors({
    required this.primary,
    required this.surface,
  });

  final Color primary;
  final Color surface;

  @override
  AppColors copyWith({Color? primary, Color? surface}) {
    return AppColors(
      primary: primary ?? this.primary,
      surface: surface ?? this.surface,
    );
  }

  @override
  AppColors lerp(ThemeExtension<AppColors>? other, double t) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Custom widgets

Wrap your design tokens in semantic widget APIs so that consuming code stays simple and consistent.

## Summary

A well-structured Flutter design system reduces duplication, improves maintainability, and keeps your UI aligned with brand guidelines. Start small, iterate, and document your decisions.
