Large organizations face unique challenges: many teams, legacy code, and the need for both autonomy and consistency.

## Monorepos

Tools like Nx, Turborepo, and pnpm workspaces help manage multiple apps and libraries in a single repository. Benefits:

- Shared tooling and CI
- Atomic refactors across packages
- Easier dependency management

## Code ownership

Define clear ownership boundaries. Use CODEOWNERS, package-level docs, and architectural decision records (ADRs) so everyone knows who maintains what.

## Design systems

A centralized design system reduces inconsistency, but it needs dedicated ownership and a clear contribution model. Consider a "design system guild" that spans design and engineering.
