Angular has evolved significantly with standalone components and signals. This guide walks you through setting up a modern Angular project and understanding the core concepts.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- A code editor (VS Code recommended with the Angular Language Service extension)

## Creating a new project

```bash
npx @angular/cli@latest new my-app --standalone
```

The `--standalone` flag ensures your app uses standalone components by default, which simplifies the module system and aligns with Angular's future direction.

## Key concepts

1. **Standalone components** — No NgModules required; components import what they need directly.
2. **Signals** — Reactive primitives that enable fine-grained reactivity without Zone.js overhead.
3. **New control flow** — `@if`, `@for`, and `@switch` replace `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, and `*ngSwitch`.

## Next steps

Explore the Angular docs for [standalone APIs](https://angular.dev) and [signals](https://angular.dev/guide/signals) to deepen your understanding.
